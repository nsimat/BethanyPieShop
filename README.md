# BethanyPieShop
BethanyPieShop is a project to build an online store with ASP.NET Core 6, Razor pages, Blazor, Unit Testing, Entity Framework Core 6, and Web APIs.

# First Step
We begin by creating an empty ASP.NET Core MVC project. 

# Second Step
We create some folders to implement the MVC design pattern:
- Models folder: for model classes
- Views folder: for views files
- ViewModels folder: for model matching with views data displaying
- Controllers folder: for controller classes
- wwwroot folder: for static elements such like CSS, JavaScript, or images files

Two mocks repositories, MockPieRepository and MockCategoryRepository, were added for testing the web application. 
At that point, we only got a static web site which can be illustrated by the following image:
